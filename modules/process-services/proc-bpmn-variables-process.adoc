= Defining process variables in {PRODUCT} processes

Process variables are visible within a specific process instance. Process variables are initialized at process creation and destroyed on process completion. You can map process variables to local variables.

.Procedure
. In your VSCode IDE, open the relevant BPMN process file to view the process in the {PRODUCT} BPMN modeler.
. Select the background of the BPMN modeler canvas and, in the upper-right corner of the modeler, click *Properties*.
. Under *Process Data* -> *Process Variables*, click the plus icon to add a new process variable and enter the following values:

* *Name*: Enter the name of the process variable, such as `order` for a process variable with order information shared by all applicable nodes in the process.
* *Data Type*: Enter a custom or standard data type of the variable, such as `org.acme.Order`.
